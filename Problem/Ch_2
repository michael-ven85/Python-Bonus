# Challenge 2: Palindrome Check

## Objective

Write a Python program that determines if a word provided by the user is a palindrome.

A word is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, "radar" is a palindrome, while "python" is not.

## Instructions

- Prompt the user to enter a word.
- Check if the word is a palindrome.
- Print a message indicating whether the word is or is not a palindrome.


## Hints

- You can compare the word to its reversed version to determine if it's a palindrome.
- Consider ignoring case differences during the check.
