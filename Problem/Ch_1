# Challenge 1: Factorial Calculation

## Objective

Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a positive integer provided by the user.

The factorial of a number `n` is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as `5!`) is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

## Instructions

- Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
- Ensure the input is valid (i.e., a positive integer).
- Calculate the factorial of the entered number.
- Print the result.

## Hints

- You can use a `for` loop or a recursive function to calculate the factorial.
- Ensure proper handling of cases where the user does not enter a valid number.
