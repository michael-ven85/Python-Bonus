# Challenge 4: Tic Tac Toe Game

## Objective

Write a Python program that allows two players to play a simple game of Tic Tac Toe in the terminal. The game should handle user input, update the game board, and determine when a player wins or the game ends in a tie.

## Instructions

- **Game Board:**  
  Represent the game board as a 3x3 grid using a list of lists. Each cell should initially contain a space (or an empty string) to indicate it is unoccupied.

- **User Input:**  
  - Prompt the players (Player X and Player O) to enter their moves in turn.  
  - Each move should be provided in a specific format, e.g., `row,col`, where `row` and `col` are numbers between 1 and 3 corresponding to the board positions.
  - Validate the user input to ensure that:
    - The input format is correct.
    - The entered row and column numbers are within the allowed range.
    - The chosen cell is not already occupied.

- **Game Logic:**  
  - After every move, update the board with the player's mark (either "X" or "O").
  - Check for a win after each move by verifying if any row, column, or diagonal has three of the same marks.
  - Also check if the board is full, which would result in a tie if no player has won.

- **Output:**  
  - After each move, display the updated game board so the players can see the current state.
  - When a player wins, announce the winning player.
  - If the game ends in a tie, print a message indicating that the game is a draw.

- **Game Loop:**  
  - Continue accepting moves until a win or tie condition is met.
  - Optionally, consider prompting the players if they want to play another round once the game has concluded.
